# battleship_project
(Fraction of) CIS 121 group project. 

Interactive battleship game

My part:
User placement of ships before "start of game"

User inputs: 
- Chosen ship
- Coordinate placed
- Direction of ship from coordinate

Outputs:
- Updating grid (eventually final grid)
- Updating menu
- Prompts for user choices
